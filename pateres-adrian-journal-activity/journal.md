## Entry 1 - [June 22, 2025]

What I learned in Git:
Today I learned how to initialize a Git repository using git init. I also practiced checking the status of files with git status and learned how to stage changes with git add.


One question or confusion I still have:
Why do I need to stage files before committing? Why not just commit directly?
