What I learned –
Today I learned how to clone a GitHub repository to a specific folder on my local machine. I also discovered that Git requires at least one file in a repository before it can be forked.

Confusion –
I'm still a bit unsure about the differences between fetch, pull, and merge, and when to use each one during collaboration.
